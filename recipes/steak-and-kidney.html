   <h1>Steak and Kidney</h1>

   <h2><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></h2>

   <p>I love to make this steak & kidney in the slow cooker and serve over mashed potatoes. 
    The meat becomes so tender. The amount of kidney is enough to give a unique flavour without being too strong or overpowering.
    If its diced finely you'd hardly know it was there.
   </p>

   <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>

   <ul>
       <li>1 kg chuck or topside steak ; diced</li>

       <li>250 g beef kidney ; diced</li>

       <li>2 onions ; diced</li>

       <li>2 cups water</li>

       <li>1 beef stock cube</li>

       <li>1/3 cup flour</li>

       <li>1/2 cup water extra</li>
       
       <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>

       <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>

       <li>Pastry Pie Top (Optional)</li>

       <li>375 g pack puff pastry</li>

       <li>1 egg yolk</li>
       
   </ul>

   <h4>STEPS</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Place steak and kidney in large pan with onions, water and crumbled stock cube. Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer covered 1½ hours or until meat is tender. (Alternatively place in a slow-cooker and cook on low 7-8 hours)</li>  

      <li>Combine flour with extra water, pepper and soy sauce. Add to steak and stir until mixture re-boils and thickens. (If using a slow-cooker add this mixture for the last 1/2 - 1 hour of cooking. Depending on your slow cooker you may need to turn the heat to high for a while so that the mixture simmers and the mixture thickens)</li>  

      <li>The steak and kidney may be served with dumplings, on its own with mashed potato and other steamed vegetables or with a pastry pie top. </li>  
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Pie Top:</strong> If making a pie top cool the meat mixture and pour into an ovenproof dish with a china egg cup in the centre to support pastry. Roll and cut pastry, then fit around moistened rim of dish. Make small cuts in pastry edge creating a scalloped effect. Brush top lightly with beaten egg. Make two slits in top of pastry to allow steam to escape. Bake in a hot oven (220°C) 10 minutes, then reduce to moderately hot (200°C) and bake for a further 20-25 minutes until pastry is golden brown and cooked through.</p>
